I am creating a demo application that should be a multi-user chat applicaiton based on streamlit. Here is how I want it to work:

- It should support multiple users on a single chatroom
- Each instance of the streamlit application will be a unique user. A random user name from a list of names should be assigned to each one as the application starts up
- Multiple users can access their local copy of the streamlit application, showing the same chatroom
- A local database will store all the chat messages across all instances of the streamlit application
- This tutorial shows how chat works in streamlit. This tutorial is focused on LLM-based chat, but we will be building a multi-user chat app instead: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/chat-and-llm-apps/build-conversational-apps

Please build this application for me
